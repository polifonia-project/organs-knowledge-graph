# ORGANS Knowledge Graph
ORGANS Knowledge Graph stores information about the organs instrument and their evolution through time.

ORGANS Knowledge Graph is described in a dedicated MELODY data story: **[ORGANS Statistics, documenting pipe organs of historic importance](https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/organs/organs_statistics)**.
