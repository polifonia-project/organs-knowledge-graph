Questions 9 October 2023
- What about inverse relations?
- Where to put the description of the building?
- Where to put the 'particularities' (text blob describing 'current' parthood)
- Can we have the place name as separate data property 
- add organnumber to organ:Organ.

Questions September 2023
- Did I do it right? See sparql query organ.sparql at github organ-knowledge-graph
- How to include geographic locations (PhysicalSite), cities, buildings.
- How to include agents. Both literal name, and disambiguated name.
- How to link with the organ lexicon? Use terms and IDs.
- Do we need persistent identifiers? How to be robust towards the future?
- How to include the rdf:type information?
- How to construct IDs?
- Should IDs be persistent?
- How to construct IRIs for intermediate nodes
- which namespaces to use (ontology/resources)
- How to include images
- How to include links to youtube videos'


Requested additions for Ontology:

-------------------
 
The location (core:PhysicalSite) should go to the Parthood instead of the Project.
 
Then the parthood always refers to a certain time and place.
 
-------------------
 
Could Windpressure, Tuning and Pitch also go to Parthood (instead of Organ). Then they have a timeInterval as well.

Windpressure, Tuning, and Pitch should have time intervals as well
 
-------------------
 
Pipes should be part of â€¦RankRange
 
Could be simplified:
 
o:OrganDivisionStop core:hasPart o:OrganDivisionStopRankRange (1:n relation)
 
o:OrganDivisionStopRankRange o:lowestkey xsd:Literal
o:OrganDivisionStopRankRange o:highestKey xsd:Literal
o:OrganDivisionStopRankRange o:hasFootHeight xsd:Literal (1:n relation)
 
o:OrganDivisionStopRankRange core:hasPart o:OrganDivisionStopRankRangePipe (1:n relation)
 
------------------
 
Missing:
o:OrganConsoleKeyboard o:hasRange xsd:Literal
 
------------------
 
Add :derivedFrom to o:OrganCase (analogous to o:organ)
 
------------------
 
Add Organ Lexicon identifier to all classes. How?
 
------------------
 
Include:
o:WindSystemBellow rdf:type ...
